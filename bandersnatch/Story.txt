The people of Winerfall has requested your help to enter the big and scary cave. You accept the quest.
Outside you meet a man, ha warns you to enter and ask you who you are. 


>>>>>>>>>>>>

You decide to enter the cave without knowing if you'll ever come out of it...


>>>>>>>>

Inside the cave you hear load screams and instantly regret you entered the cave. 
You think to yourself "I should have listened to the weird man, maybe I should go back before it's too late". 
But as you turn around to get out you realise it's already too late, the entrance is blocked.
You now have no choice but to find another way out...

>>>>>>>

With help of the light of the flashlight you start walking. The screams seems to disappear for a while. 
In front of you you meet a crossroad. You can either go right or left. Which way do you go?

<<< LEFT >>>

You chose the left path and keep on walking. Suddenly you stumble on something. 
Should you take a look?

<<< LEFT, YES >>>
Underneath a pile of soil you find a purse. 
You don't know the use of it but pick it up anyway. 

<<< LEFT, NO >>>
Keep on going forward. 

<<< LEFT, YES/NO >>>
You stop for a second as you see the passage is narrowing down. 
At the same time the flashlight start to flicker, you can't see the end of the passage and wonder for how long you have to walk in this condition. 
You think to yourself "Should I run the rest of the part? Or should I go back to find something more?".

readline

<<< LEFT, YES/NO, CONTINUE >>>
You hope for the best and start to run. 

The flashlight continues to flicker as you run through the narrow passage.
When you see the end of the passage you also see smoke covering it. 
Suddenly the flashlight dies. 
What are you going to do? Start crawling or play it cool?

<<< LEFT, YES/NO, CONTINUE, CRAWLING >>>
After crawling for a while you see a red light in front of you. 
You continue towards it and soon you see a pair of shoes. 
As you look up you see the weird man you met outside the cave. 
He starts to laugh and says "you can get up now".
As you raise he follows it up with only two words "Receipt please".
Do you now what he talks about?

<<< LEFT, YES/NO, CONTINUE, CRAWLING, YES && receipt >>>
If(receipt) {
    Console.WriteLine("You remember the receipt from the bar and give it to the man.");

    The receipt is visual and you need to spell the right buzzword. 
    readline("");

    if(buzzword == "true") {
        Console.WriteLine("\"Enjoy! - weird man\"");
        Console.WriteLine("The weird man opens a hidden door to let you in.");
    }
    else {
        Console.WriteLine("Please try again");
    }
}
<<< LEFT, YES/NO, CONTINUE, CRAWLING, YES && !receipt || NO>>>
If(!receipt) {
    Console.WriteLine("You don't know what he talks about");
}
You need to go back to the beginning.

<<< LEFT, YES/NO, CONTINUE, PLAY IT COOL >>>
After playing it cool for a while you see a red light in front of you. 
You continue towards it soon you see the weird man you met outside the cave. 
He also plays it cool and says only two words "Receipt please".
Do you now what he talks about?

<<< LEFT, YES/NO, CONTINUE, PLAY IT COOL, YES && receipt >>>
If(receipt) {
    Console.WriteLine("You remember the receipt from the bar and give it to the man.");

    The receipt is visual and you need to spell the right buzzword. 
    readline("");

    if(buzzword == "true") {
        Console.WriteLine("\"Enjoy! - weird man\"");
        Console.WriteLine("The weird man opens a hidden door to let you in.");
    }
    else {
        Console.WriteLine("Please try again");
    }
}

<<< LEFT, YES/NO, CONTINUE, PLAY IT COOL, YES && !receipt || NO>>>
If(!receipt) {
    Console.WriteLine("You don't know what he talks about");
}
You need to go back to the beginning.

<<< LEFT, YES/NO, CONTINUE, PLAY IT COOL || CRAWLING, YES && receipt >>>
You walk through he door and meet deafening screams. 
You now understand that it's a party going on.
You chill for a bit before you recognize some people having a laugh in the corner. 
You go over to see what's so funny. 
It's a balloon machine. 
You want to buy one. Do you have any money?

<<< HAVE MONEY >>>
You buy a balloon which takes you up...

<<< DON'T HAVE MONEY >>>
Unfortunally you don't have any coins. 
Död?

<<< LEFT, YES/NO, GO BACK >>>
You come back to beginning. 

<<< RIGHT >>>
You walk from the screams. You are not ready yet!
In the distance you see a light. 
You follow it and find yourself in a bar. 
The bar is empty, but you find a receipt. 
You read it.

Map of receipt visual. 

You can't make any sense of it but put it in your pocket. 
You can now either go forward or look more in the bar. 
What do you do?

<<< RIGHT, LOOK MORE IN THE BAR >>>
if(purse) {
    You find some coins in the old cashier and realise why you have the purse.
    You put the coins in the purse and continues.
}

if(!purse) {
    You find some coins in the old cashier but don't know where to put them.
    You have to leave the cashier. 
}

if(looked twice) {
    It's nothing left in the bar.
}

<<< RIGHT, FORWARD >>>
You walk forward and hear the screams once again.
You now have the choice to follow the screams or walk towards the scary silence. 
Which way do you choose?

<<< RIGHT, FORWARD, SCREAMS >>>
Du hamnar i den vänstra korridoren?

<<< RIGHT, FORWARD, SCARY SILENCE >>>
The silence is creeping up on you. But you keep on walking.
Suddenly the ground disappear under you feet. 
You fall and fall until you find yourself at a party.
There is no way out. 
The only thing you can do is take drugs and die a slowly death. 
You died. Back to start. 

<<< ENDING >>>
The next morning: 
You wake up and realise you had the most fucked up dream ever!
